 * Watto and Mechanism
Watto, the owner of a spare parts store, has recently got an order for the mechanism that can process strings in a certain way. Initially the memory of the mechanism is filled with nn strings. Then the mechanism should be able to process queries of the following type: "Given string ss, determine if the memory of the mechanism contains string tt that consists of the same number of characters as ss and differs from ss in exactly one position".

Watto has already compiled the mechanism, all that's left is to write a program for it and check it on the data consisting of nn initial lines and mm queries. He decided to entrust this job to you.

Input
The first line contains two non-negative numbers nn and mm (0 \le n \le 3*10^5, 0 \le m \le 3*10^5)(0≤n≤3∗10
​5
​​ ,0≤m≤3∗10
​5
​​ ) — the number of the initial strings and the number of queries, respectively.

Next follow nn non-empty strings that are uploaded to the memory of the mechanism.

Next follow mm non-empty strings that are the queries to the mechanism.

The total length of lines in the input doesn't exceed 6*10^56∗10
​5
​​ . Each line consists only of letters 'a', 'b', 'c'

Output
For each query print on a single line "YES" (without the quotes), if the memory of the mechanism contains the required string, otherwise print "NO" (without the quotes).
