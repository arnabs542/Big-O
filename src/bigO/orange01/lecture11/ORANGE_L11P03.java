 * Aibohphobia
BuggyD suffers from AIBOHPHOBIA - the fear of Palindromes. A palindrome is a string that reads the same forward and backward.

To cure him of this fatal disease, doctors from all over the world discussed his fear and decided to expose him to large number of palindromes. To do this, they decided to play a game with BuggyD. The rules of the game are as follows:

BuggyD has to supply a string SS. The doctors have to add or insert characters to the string to make it a palindrome. Characters can be inserted anywhere in the string.

The doctors took this game very lightly and just appended the reverse of SS to the end of SS, thus making it a palindrome. For example, if S = "fft", the doctors change the string to "ffttff".

Nowadays, BuggyD is cured of the disease (having been exposed to a large number of palindromes), but he still wants to continue the game by his rules. He now asks the doctors to insert the minimum number of characters needed to make SS a palindrome. Help the doctors accomplish this task.

For instance, if SS = "fft", the doctors should change the string to "tfft", adding only 11 character.

Input
Each test case consists of one line, the string SS. The length of SS will be no more than 61006100 characters, and SS will contain no whitespace characters.

Output
Output one line containing a single integer denoting the minimum number of characters that must be inserted into SS to make it a palindrome.

Ví dụ
input
fft
Output
1
