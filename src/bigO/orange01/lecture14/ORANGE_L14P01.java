 Gaint and Sifat
One day Sifat and his mysterious friend went to jungle to had a picnic . They were so involved with their conversation that they lost their way back to home . It was already quiet late and so they decided to find a safe place to spend rest of the night . They found a cave that was big and clean . They thought it was the best place to wait for dawn and then they could easily find their way back to home . But Alas it was a cave of Gaint you know who . At mid night Gaint , you know who came back to his cave and caught sifat and his mysterious friend .

It was Sifat’s good luck or bad luck Gaint you know who was vegetarian but didn’t want to lose the chance to play with sifat and his mysterious friend . Gaint , you know who used to be a problem solver so he told sifat that he would give him a sentence SS and a word ss . Sifat had to find how many times word ss occurs as a substring of SS ( you can safely omit all spaces from the sentence in order to find the substring occurrence ) .

Input
Input starts with a integer T ( T \le 30 )T(T≤30) , denoting the number of test cases . Each case starts with two line . First line contains SS and second line contains ss.

Constraints:

1 \le T \le 301≤T≤30
1 \le |S| \le 1000001≤∣S∣≤100000
1 \le |s| \le |S|1≤∣s∣≤∣S∣
Output
For each case first print case number and then print number of times s occurs as a substring in SS after removing all spaces from SS .
