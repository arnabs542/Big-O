 Password
Asterix, Obelix and their temporary buddies Suffix and Prefix has finally found the Harmony temple. However, its doors were firmly locked and even Obelix had no luck opening them.

A little later they found a string ss, carved on a rock below the temple's gates. Asterix supposed that that's the password that opens the temple and read the string aloud. However, nothing happened. Then Asterix supposed that a password is some substring tt of the string ss.

Prefix supposed that the substring tt is the beginning of the string ss; Suffix supposed that the substring tt should be the end of the string ss; and Obelix supposed that tt should be located somewhere inside the string ss, that is, tt is neither its beginning, nor its end.

Asterix chose the substring tt so as to please all his companions. Besides, from all acceptable variants Asterix chose the longest one (as Asterix loves long strings). When Asterix read the substring tt aloud, the temple doors opened.

You know the string ss. Find the substring tt or determine that such substring does not exist and all that's been written above is just a nice legend.

Input
You are given the string ss whose length can vary from 11 to 10^610
​6
​​  (inclusive), consisting of small Latin letters.

Output
Print the string tt. If a suitable tt string does not exist, then print Just a legend.
