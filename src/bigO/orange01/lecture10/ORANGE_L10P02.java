 * K-based Numbers
Let’s consider KK-based numbers, containing exactly NN digits. We define a number to be valid if its KK-based notation doesn’t contain two successive zeros. For example:

•	10102301010230 is a valid 77-digit number;
•	10001981000198 is not a valid number;
•	00012350001235 is not a 77-digit number, it is a 44-digit number.

Given two numbers NN and KK, you are to calculate an amount of valid KK based numbers, containing NN digits.
You may assume that 2 \le K \le 10; N \ge 2; N + K \le 182≤K≤10;N≥2;N+K≤18.

Input
The numbers NN and KK in decimal notation separated by the line break.

Output
The result in decimal notation.
